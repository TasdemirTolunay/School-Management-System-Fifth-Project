## Description About The Project

---

- Database of a school management system has been created.

- H2 is used as the database system.

- The connection of the project with h2 is made using Spring Data Jpa.

- Querying, updating and deleting operations can be performed With Spring Boot Get, Post, Put and Delete mapping.

- The design of the project was made in accordance with the UML diagram.

- Swagger was used to perform Get, Post, Put and Delete mapping operations.

- DTO(Data Transfer Object) is used as request and response object.

- Thrown errors are logged in the database.

- Salary update informations is kept as a separate table in the database.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

` git clone https://github.com/113-GittiGidiyor-Java-Spring-Bootcamp/fourth-homework-TasdemirTolunay.git `

2. If you have maven available in your local, for mapper operations to occur :

` mvn install `

3. If you don't have maven in your local, intellij idea program is easy to perform "maven install". When the project is opened with Intellij idea, click on the text maven on the right side of the screen, double-click on the "install" statement in the lifecycle.

## Usage

---
- When you run the project, you can perform mapping with swagger. The url used for Swagger is:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

- example usages are given on the student controller.
- Similar operations apply to address, course and instructor controllers.


- Mapping operations applicable to the student :

- Put mapping for update a student :

![UpdateStudent](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/UpdateStudent1.jpg)

- The student with ID number 2 has been updated.

### Instructor Salary Update

---
- You can apply a percentage raise or reduction to an instructor's salary.

- Example Incraise Salary;
    - Let's increase the salary of the instructor whose id is one.
    - Before update ínstructors salary:
    
    ![BeforeUpdateSalary](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/beforeIncraise.jpg)
    - While updating, it is specified in which instructor's salary, what type and how many percent salary changes will be made.
    
    ![WhenUpdating](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/WhenIncraiseChange.jpg)
    - After update instructors salary:
    
    ![AfterUpdate](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/AfterIncraise.jpg)

- Example Reduction Salary;
    - Let's reduction the salary of the instructor whose id is two.
    - Before update ínstructors salary:

    ![BeforeUpdateSalary](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/BeforeReduction.jpg)
    - While updating, it is specified in which instructor's salary, what type and how many percent salary changes will be made.

    ![WhenUpdating](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/WhenReductionChange.jpg)
    - After update instructors salary:

    ![AfterUpdate](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/AfterReduction.jpg)

- Salary update information is kept as a separate table in the database.
  
![SalaryUpdateTable](SchoolSystem/src/main/java/images/SalaryUpdateDataChange.jpg)

- Salary update informations can be queried with instructor id and request time.

- Salary update query with request time:
